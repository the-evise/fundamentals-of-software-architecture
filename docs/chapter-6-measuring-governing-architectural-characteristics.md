decomposing composite architectural characteristics into their consituent parts is an important part of establishing objective definitions for architecture characteristics which solves all there of these problems.

architects are responsible for defining components and interactions, and want to build a sustainable structure for overall high quality.

architects and developers universally agree that overly complex code represents a code smell so bad that it has an imaginary odor.

metrics like CC are extremely useful for assessing code, whether it's written by developers or generative AI. generative AI tends to solve problems by brute force often leading to accidental complexity.

engineering practices like test driven development TDD have the beneficial side effect of generating smaller less complex methods on average for a given problem domain. when practicing TDD, developers try to write a simple test, then write the smallest amount of code to pass the test.

Governance, derived from the Greek work kubernan (to steer) is an important responsibility of the architect role.

Fitness functions an object function used to assess how close the output comes to achieving its aim.

modularity is an implicit architecture characteristic that most architects care about. architects generally place a high priority on maintaining good modularity.

architects must ensure that developers understand the purpose of a fitness function before imposing it on them.

it's not a question of if something will eventually break but when. anticipating those breakages and testing to prevent them makes the system more robust.

when professionals do a highly detailed job over and over it becomes easy for details to slip by them a succinct checklist forms an effective reminder.

a mechanism for architects to express and automatically verify important architectural principles.
